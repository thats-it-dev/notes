# Notes, that's it

this is a very simple, local first note taking app. Open it and start typing.

## Features

- **local first**: notes are stored locally in the browser using indexedDB. This means they're available offline at any time.
- **markdown**: full markdown support for formatting your notes.
- **slash commands**: use `/` commands to create tasks, links, images, etc.
- **task tracking**: create a task anywhere and view it in a global task list.
- **search**: search through all your notes by tags and keywords.

## Block-Based Editor

The notes app uses a custom block-based editor (similar to Notion):

- **Click a block** to edit with markdown syntax visible
- **Click away** to see formatted view
- **Press Enter** to create new block
- **Type `/`** to open slash command menu
- **Auto-formatting**: Type `# ` for heading, `[ ] ` for task, etc.

# Notes, that's it

this is a very simple, local first note taking app. Open it and start typing.

## Features

- **local first**: notes are stored locally in the browser using indexedDB. This means they're available offline at any time.
- **markdown**: full markdown support for formatting your notes.
- **slash commands**: use `/` commands to create tasks, links, images, etc.
- **task tracking**: create a task anywhere and view it in a global task list.
- **search**: search through all your notes by tags and keywords.

## Notes is better with Sync!

[Sync, that's it]() is a service that provides:

- **real-time sync**: your notes are synced across all devices.
- **backup**: your notes are backed up to the cloud.
- **API access**: access your notes & tasks from anywhere using an open API.
- **MCP support**: access your notes & tasks via Claude, Cursor, or any other MCP client. 

Its $5 a month, but you can also host it yourself!
